EFRONT VERSION 3.6 QUICK INSTALLATION GUIDE
-----------------------------------------

Prerequisites
=============
Latest version of XAMPP or:
- PHP 5.2.0 or higher (PHP 5.1.x or 5.0.x are supported but using a version earlier than 5.2 is not recommended)
- Mysql 5.0 (MySQL 4.1 can be used but is not recommended)
- Apache 2 (Apache 1.3.xx can be used but is not recommended)


Installation step-by-step guide
===============================
1. Download eFront zip archive, from https://sourceforge.net/projects/efrontlearning/ (or from the provided URL, if you are using a commercial version)
2. Follow the "Microsoft Windows" or the "Linux" instructions at the next sections, to setup a working environment for efront
3. Using your browser, access the location http://localhost/install/install.php. If you are setting efront on a host that has a domain name, for example "www.example.com", then you should access it with this name, http://www.example.com/install/install.php 
4. Click the «Install» button
5. The first step lists the prerquisites and settings required in order for the system to work correctly. If there aren't any errors, you may click on continue. If you see red "forbidden" icons or yellow "warning" icons, please consult the "troubleshooting" section below
6. At the second step, you must insert the database settings. Database type is always "MySQL". Database host is usually "localhost" (in some cases it may be a single dot "."). For default XAMPP installations, the database user is "root" and password may be left blank. You can set any name for the database, preferrably "efront".Finally, in this step you must provide the administrator account details. Also you may click on the checkbox to allow the system to create default lessons and users. Clicking "Install" will finalize installation
7. Installation is now complete. You may click on the provided link to automatically delete the installation directory and redirect to the system's first page, http://localhost/index.php
8. If you are using a commercial version of eFront, login with the administrator account and click on the "Registration" icon. Insert the key that was provided to you in the text box and click "submit". This will unlock your version's functionality 

Setup a working environment (Microsoft Windows)
===============================================
1. Create a folder, for example c:\efront, and uncompress the eFront files in this folder, thus creating the following structure:
C:\efront\backups
C:\efront\libraries
C:\efront\PEAR
C:\efront\upload
C:\efront\www
C:\efront\Zend
2. If you don't have already a working Apache/Mysql/PHP environment, download and install XAMPP for Windows, from http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html 
3. After installing XAMPP, you must edit the file c:\xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf (with any text editor, like Notepad) 
and perform the following chages:
   - Change the line where it says:
     DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs"
     to:
     DocumentRoot "C:/efront/www"
   - Change the line where it says:
     <Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs">
     to:
     <Directory "C:/efront/www">
4. Using the XAMPP control panel (or manually) restart Apache service     


Setup a working environment (Linux)
===================================
1. Uncompress eFront files in the desired folder, for example /opt/lampp/efront, thus creating the following structure:
/opt/lampp/efront/backups
/opt/lampp/efront/libraries
/opt/lampp/efront/PEAR
/opt/lampp/efront/upload
/opt/lampp/efront/www
/opt/lampp/efront/Zend
2. If you don't have already a working Apache/Mysql/PHP environment, download and install XAMPP for Linux, from http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html 
3. After installing XAMPP, you must edit the file /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf (with any text editor) 
and perform the following chages:
   - Change the line where it says:
     DocumentRoot "/opt/lampp/htdocs/"
     to:
     DocumentRoot "/opt/lampp/efront/www"
   - Change the line where it says:
     <Directory "/opt/lampp/htdocs">
     to:
     <Directory "/opt/lampp/efront/www">
4. Using the XAMPP control panel (or manually) restart Apache service     

Note: Several directories should be writable by the web server, but the most important is libraries/smarty, 
since it is needed in order to perform installation

Troubleshooting
===============
1. One or more red "forbidden" icons appear in step 1 of Installation, at the "Mandatory PHP extesions" section (usually the ZIP extension)
	This means that a mandatory PHP extension is missing. These extensions are needed by efront to function correctly, and are all default
	in PHP 5.2+ installations. If you are on a hosted environment, then ask your hosting provider to install them. If you are on a local windows
	environment, then visit www.php.net and download the corresponding .dll file, which you should place inside PHP's ext/ folder. If you 
	are on a linux environment, running "pecl install <extension name>" should do the job
2. One or more red "forbidden" icons appear in step 1 of Installation, at the "Mandatory PHP Settings" section (usually the magic_quotes_gpc setting)
	This means that some PHP settings that are mandatory for efront to function properly are not set or are set in different values than the recommended, and the system failed to fix them automatically
	Recommended settings are:
	magic_quotes_gpc = Off
	register_globals = Off
	session.save_path = "/path/to/writable/dir/"		(where /path/to/writable/dir/ is a directory where the web server can write, for example /tmp for Linux or C:\WINDOWS\Temp for windows)
	Please note that these are the default values for PHP installations and any other setting is strongly advised against from the PHP community
	There are many ways to fix this situation:
	a) If you are installing efront on your own server or locally, edit the file php.ini and change the settings accordingly. For windows xampp installations, the correct php.ini is located inside c:\xampp\apache\bin. Remember to restart your apache server after any changes in this file	 
	b) If you are installing efront on a shared hosting environment, then you can do the following:
		- Create a file called "php.ini"
		- Place the above recommended settings inside this file. Set /path/to/writable/dir/ to something writable, usually /tmp will work
		- Upload the file php.ini inside efront's www/ and www/install/ folders
		- Reload the page with step 1 to see if the settings changed 
	c) If the above method does not work, try the following:
		- Create a file called ".htaccess"
		- Place the following commands inside it:		
			php_flag register_globals off
			php_flag magic_quotes_gpc off
			php_flag session.save_path "/path/to/writable/dir/"
		- Upload this file inside efront's www/ folder
		- Reload the page with step 1 to see if the settings changed. If you get a "Server Error" message, remove the file you uploaded
	d) If none of the above methods work, contact your hosting provider and ask them how to set them
3. One or more red "forbidden" icons appear in step 1 of Installation, at the "Filesystem Permissions" section (usually in Linux installations)
	These are the folders that efront must have write access to, so you should edit these folder's permissions to "writable" for the web server (for example, by changing ownership). 
	The "libraries/" folder may be set to non-writable after the installation finishes
4. One or more yellow "warning" icons appear in step 1 of Installation, at the "Optional PHP extesions" section
	These are PHP extensions that are not mandatory for efront. If you don't have them installed, you may safely ignore them and proceed with the installation
5. One or more yellow "warning" icons appear in step 1 of Installation, at the "Recommended PHP Settings" section
 	These are PHP settings that are recommended to be set in specific values or ranges, but efront will work anyway. The most important is "memory_limit" which may give you errors if it is set too low 
6. I get a "Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '{' in some/dir/efront/www/index.php on line 34"
	This means that your server is set to execute scripts with PHP4. eFront requires PHP 5 to work, contact your system administrator to resolve this issue 
7. After installing XAMPP, I can't start apache, what's wrong?
	If you are running skype, it might be blocking apache's default port. Try restarting your computer
